# Financing Health

## Know the preston scale
  * More wealth per capita the healthier the nation tends to be.  
  * Money does matter, albeit with diminishing returns  
  * In Logspace this is linear

## What are instrumentable variables (IV)?
  * Looking for the exogenous parts of health  
  * Those that are caused by income increased and not the reverse  
  * Google that shit later

## Development Assistance for Health
  * Bilateral aid agencies where the expressed interest for health  
  * (DAH) Developmental Assistance for health  
  * Monitored at the channel level  
  * Financing researching team monitors all of this  
  * Only long term sustainable impact **specifically** for health

## [Check this data viz link](http://vizhub.healthdata.org/fgh/)
  * Health funding channel rates have three epics  
  * follows pattern of interst in Global health stagnation and financial crisis  
  * NGO's are rapidly growing think bill and Melinda  
  * WHO is having a smaller share effect in health development  
  * There are both bar annd geo graphs to compare percentage and overall numbers
  * You can see that a lot of DAH money goes to AIDS compared to NCDs

## Trends in DAH
  * Countries prefer to send money to stable countries over unstable  
  * This is mostly due to uneven economic development and security apparatus  
  * Faith based NGO's are growing in there DAH  
  * But so are secular groups  

# Government Health Expenditure

## What is it?
  * Government Health Expenditure (GHE/GHEE/GHEA)  
  * Government Health Expenditure from Source (GHES)  
  * Development Health Assitance through Government (DAHG)  
  * GHE is increasing overtime/development status  
  * The real catalyst for health change is enabling the government to booster their own development  
  * Sub Saharan Africa has some anomlies  

## GHE Trends
  * Increasing DAHG results in decreasing GHES (both in absolute and relative terms)  
    * This is a corss sectional transfer w/in government  
    * Conditional grants try to overide this  
  * What about the reverse when DAHG decreases 
  * Consider that for every one dollar spent on DAHG GHES decreases by 62 cents
  * When the aid goes away the money generally is not replaced at least not annualy  
  * Elasticty - percentage change that leads to a percentage change

# Global Health Resource Tracker

## Overview
  * Extension of GBD  
  * Compiles health resource flow which can then be linked to health loss by disease  
  * Essential to link resource consumption to disease level  
  * Answers questions like  
    * How are funds raised, channeled  
    * Inputs to outputs  

## How is GHRT different from current systems
  * National Health Accounts (NHAs)  
    * Rigourous accounting framework  
    * Does  not employ disease framework  
  * GHRT
    * Disease and Economic framework  

## Source -> channel -> Implementing Institute ->  
## Inputs -> Interventions -> Needs -> Beneficiary  

1. Funding Source  
  * Revenue Streams  
2. Funding Channel  
  * Government sectors or other
3. Platforms  
  * Institutes that implement public health programs (hospitals, pharmicies and shit)  
4. Inputs  
  * The cost centers on which funds are spent  
5. Interventions (Outputs)  
  * Action/Procedure/Bundle of Procedures **and** mode of delivery  
6. Intervention Classification  
  * 4 cats of function of care amongst list of major disease per region  
7. Beneficiaries  
  * By Age, Sex, Health Status, Country, Year  


## Modeling  
  * Data Sources -> cleaning -> Modeling (the usual)  
  * Essential to reconcile the micro to macro just like GBD  
  * Internal consistancy mantra  
  * [Check out the slides here for data modeling pathway](https://catalyst.uw.edu/workspace/file/download/4ccfaed0533c897648cd7a83ca3523831cdfc0d2f37d506acb17d972c38a3950)  
  * Again built on Econometrics models  

## Deliverables
  * Understandability/Accountability/Efficiency/Cost Effectiveness/Performance  

## Phasing  
  1. US  
    * Consumption, no interventions, all diseases  
  2. Zambia  
    * All views, key interventions, select diseases  
  3. Regional Anchors  
  4. Countries with complete data  
  5. Countries with missingness  

# Efficiency of Health Funding  

## Why are we interested in health (in)efficiancy?  
  * Central for policy makers  
  * Ease burden of public health expenditures  
  * Scarce resources  

# Finance Overview  

## What themes did you see througout the sessions?  
  * Differentiating source from channel  
  * Accurately tracking funding pathways and attributing sources  
  * Importance of Measuring performance goals via various metrics  
  * Internal Consistency  
  * Preston curve  


## Which funder didnt we discuss explicitely today? Why? How?  
  * Individual level funding  
  * How much moey is a sick individual paying for their own care  
  * Good data sources are hard to come by  

# Intro to Health Systems  

## What is a health system?
  * If your primary intent is health then youre a part of it  

## A Well functioning health care system should have...  
  * Good Health Outcomes  
  * Household Financial Protection  
  * Responsiveness  
  * Sustainability and Country Competitiveness  

## Risk Pooling Models  
  * National Health Service (Beveridge)  
    * Single pool from general Gov revenue  
  * Payroll Tax (Bismarck)  
    * Multiple tools based on labor status, funded by pay-roll tax  
  * Private risk-rated insurers  
    * Competing insurers  
  * Community based health insurance  
    * non traditional  

## Methods for provider incentive  
  * Block Funding  
    * Full costs are reimbursed to providers  
  * Capitation  
    * Fixed amount per patient enrolled  
  * Fee for service  
    * Fixed amount for service
  * DRGs  
    * Fixed amount for disease treated  

## Benifits Package Components  
  * Interventions  
  * Quality  
  * co-payments, deductibles  
  * confidentiality  

## Difficulty with Universal Coverage  
  * Low Income Country: extending basic services is difficult  
  * Middle Income Countries: deeping the quality is difficult, especially with risk pooling fragmentation  
  * High Income Countries: How do we sustain the health care system we have
